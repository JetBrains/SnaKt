# Conflict solving diary

## 2026-09-14

- Read `AUTOMATIONS.md` and recorded this run in `automationsInstructions/conflict-solving.md` before investigating the pull request.
- Confirmed the checkout is on `test/floating-point-rejection`, whose pull request targets `implementing-air-automations`, as required.
- Fetched the current source and base refs without switching branches.
- Queried GitHub for PR #391 at head `0402739f14fe812f1771e2d54aebeea77919ff3f`; GitHub reported `MERGEABLE` and `CLEAN`.
- Expanded the shallow checkout so Git could independently find the merge base.
- Ran `git merge-tree --write-tree origin/implementing-air-automations HEAD`; it produced a merged tree successfully with no conflict diagnostics.
- Concluded that the synchronize event did not introduce a merge conflict, so no source or golden-file edits were necessary.
