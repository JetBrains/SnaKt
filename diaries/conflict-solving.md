- Read `AUTOMATIONS.md` and recorded this run in `automationsInstructions/conflict-solving.md` before investigating the pull request.
- Confirmed the checkout is on `test/floating-point-rejection`, whose pull request targets `implementing-air-automations`, as required.
- Fetched the current source and base refs without switching branches.
- Queried GitHub for PR #391 at head `0402739f14fe812f1771e2d54aebeea77919ff3f`; GitHub reported `MERGEABLE` and `CLEAN`.
- Expanded the shallow checkout so Git could independently find the merge base.
- Ran `git merge-tree --write-tree origin/implementing-air-automations HEAD`; it produced a merged tree successfully with no conflict diagnostics.
- Concluded that the synchronize event did not introduce a merge conflict, so no source or golden-file edits were necessary.

## 2026-09-14 — synchronized head check

- Read `AUTOMATIONS.md` and updated `automationsInstructions/conflict-solving.md` for this run before changing the pull request branch.
- Confirmed the checkout is on `test/floating-point-rejection` and PR #391 still targets `implementing-air-automations`.
- Fetched both current remote refs without switching branches. The checked-out head is `4741195f3218a9e21d48ebc21bc28fc0fe4ad13a`; the base is `9bac7b389dc5d2e01ffe14b0f92b69f134866c87`.
- Deepened the shallow checkout until Git found the base commit as the merge base.
- Ran `git merge-tree --write-tree origin/implementing-air-automations HEAD`; it produced merged tree `afc4bb6477ab6a0a470ca13c1d51c07af93f8075` with no conflict diagnostics.
- Queried GitHub for PR #391 at the same revisions; GitHub reported `MERGEABLE` and `CLEAN`.
- Ran `git diff --check origin/implementing-air-automations...HEAD`; it completed successfully.
- Concluded that the synchronized head has no merge conflict, so no source or golden-file edits were needed.
